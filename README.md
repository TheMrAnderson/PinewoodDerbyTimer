# This PDT is configured to run a Space Derby through a specially made track

The original source code is from https://www.dfgtec.com/pdt-software.  Please reference this for configuration information.  I'll try to answer any questions, but I just modified existing code to adapt it for our track.

- Configured to run 4 lanes
- Lane place/time digital displays are in place

### Original Project Read Me
The Pinewood Derby Timer (PDT) is an Arduino based track timer. The robust and 
flexible design allows the PDT to be easily constructed and modified to meet 
your specific needs. Features of the PDT include:

 - Easily expandable from 1 to 6 lanes
 - Supports (optional) solenoid start gate circuit
 - Supports (optional) lane place/time digital displays
 - Works standalone or can be interfaced to software running on a PC
 - Supports lane masking, start gate status check, force end of race

Interfacing the PDT to software running a PC allows races to be managed and 
allows you to record and archive car run times as you test/tune your Pinewood 
Derby car(s). The PDT is currently compatible with the following software: 

 - Free PD Test/Tune/Track (PDT3) software utility
 - The popular Grand Prix Race Manager software
